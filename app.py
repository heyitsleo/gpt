More details refer to [arxiv: 2301.07597](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07597) and Gtihub project [Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-comparison-detection](https://github.com/Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-comparison-detection). The base checkpoint is [roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base). We train it with all [Hello-SimpleAI/HC3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hello-SimpleAI/HC3) data (without held-out) for 1 epoch. (1-epoch is consistent with the experiments in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07597)").launch()
